I'm not great at legal stuff, so i'll put this as plainly as i can.

I the creator of Crystal Editor, as in the account currently by the name of "Dawnbomb"  who owns this repository on github, 
is the sole owner of anything and everything in this repository. Every Line of code, every image, every resource, every last thing.
If you contibute, you have no rights whatsoever. You help me in exchange for nothing, and lose all rights to everything you contirbute.

In every concieveable way you could lose your rights to anyway you can even potentially contribute, you lose the rights to it.

In every way, Physically, Digitally, theoretically, actually, imaginatively, in this world, the universe, and all of existance, i own the rights 
everything you contribute (as in a pull request) to Crystal Editor.

One day i may sell Crystal Editor, although maybe under a diffrent name, on steam or other platforms or websites. I want all rights as mine, and mine alone,
to be able to do that. 

ALL RIGHTS ARE RESERVED, this is NOT Open Source. 

If you download the project, add code to it, and make a pull request and it is accepted, you cannot claim any ownership to anything in here. 
This lisence is the way it is, for the following reasons.

1)  I need it this way to potentially, if i choose to, sell or monetize the program, in order to hire people to make it better.

2) I have had projects where someone demanded their things back, that were so integrated into the core of a project, removing them completly destroyed
the project. Other times it set the project many months behind. I refuse to allow this to happen to Crystal Editor.

3) I have dealt with far to many bad actors over the years, and after finally filing and wining some lawsuits, i'm done trusting people.
If you want some rights, contact me and ask. However any would be rights, would be explicitly added to this lisence document.
Any supposed rights anyone claims, not explicitly acnowledged in this document are fake. 


In addition to no rights, you agree that anything you add to Crystal Editor, is infact your own creation. That you are not stealing, or taking the works of
anyone else and adding them to it in a pull request. If you were to do so, under whatever laws apply, I, as in Crystal Editor, will hold you legally liable
for any theft from angry third partys for infringing on their rights.

The only things added to this repository i do not claim to own, are classified as "Tools" with Crystal Editor. 
A Tool is a program made by someone else, that does something i did not make, nor anyone directly in this project.
At the time of writing this agreement (December 6 2022), all tools currently in the project are all open source, except 010 editor (CE uses the 
free demo version of 010, not the paid version. Users must buy 010 off their website to access the full version of that Tool). However, in the future i may
attempt to request usage of certain closed source tools to allow them to be added to Crystal Editor. Any potential future sale of crystal editor,
is not a sale of any such Tools. Also, The version of 010 Editor included as a Tool in Crystal Editor, is the free demo version, explicitly requiring
people buy the full version to use it fully. Crystal Editor does not include any paid
